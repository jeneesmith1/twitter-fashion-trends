# Using Twitter's API to find random tweets :bird:


Sometimes it can be nice to see some random tweets, right? 

I made this small project to enjoy the process of finding random tweets without opening Twitter.

This very simple command-line app takes in user input and outputs a few tweets.

# Example

```
    python3 twitter-fashion.py
```

# Requirements

1. tweepy
2. json
3. datetime
4. time
5. os
6. python3

You will need to get a developer account at Twitter and enable their API to add your credentials.
